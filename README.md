🚀 **Stop losing crucial logic in massive context windows.** While Claude Opus 4.8 and the newly released Fable 5 / Mythos 5 reasoning models support ultra-large token capacities, deep long-context processing is still highly prone to "Needle in a Haystack" hallucinations. 

This high-performance background agent automatically scans, cleans, and packs your local repository into a highly dense semantic map. It eliminates token bloat while ensuring the newest hybrid reasoning layers understand your exact project architecture instantly.
